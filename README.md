# Manufacturing & Financial Data Analytics Hub

## 📊 Project Overview
end-to-end data pipeline platform that integrates manufacturing operational data with financial metrics. Built with Python, PostgreSQL, and Apache Airflow, it demonstrates modern data engineering practices including ETL orchestration, star schema warehousing, and business intelligence visualization.

The project showcases the complete data lifecycle from raw data ingestion through transformation to interactive dashboards—providing a scalable foundation for manufacturing performance analysis.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a **production-ready ETL pipeline** for manufacturing data
- Implement a **star schema data warehouse** in PostgreSQL for analytical queries
- Demonstrate **workflow orchestration** with Apache Airflow
- Create **interactive BI dashboards** with Tableau Public
- Establish **CI/CD practices** using Docker and GitHub Actions
- Produce **actionable insights** combining manufacturing and financial metrics

## 🧠 How the Project Works

The system operates through three integrated layers:

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion & Staging
Raw manufacturing data (production logs, machine sensors) and financial records are:
- Extracted from source files/APIs
- Validated for completeness and accuracy
- Staged in temporary tables for transformation


### 2️⃣ Transformation & Warehousing
The ETL process:
- Cleans and normalizes raw data
- Applies business logic and calculations
- Loads into a **star schema** with fact and dimension tables
- Maintains slowly changing dimensions for historical accuracy
